Fraud detection and prevention
==============================

Fraud basic setup and specification
-----------------------------------

Fraud prevention and traffic filtering service (FlexyGuard) is a dedicated web-service which pre-processes all payment requests.
The Guard system analyses payment request snapshot and applies set of filters to return a scoring remark back to Public API.

Every payment request is re-routed to FlexyGuard in the first place

Monitoring and filter alerts
----------------------------

The Guard system assigns a check result and a score to every payment request and sends the result back to the caller.
Filtered payment requests could be monitored via Analytics/Reporting interface on a dedicated dashboard.

Appropriate alerting mechanism could be set for scoring aggregated number or payment decline reason or any day-to-day fraud monitoring process requirements
in Analytics/Reporting system

Basic traffic filtering rules syntax
------------------------------------

Any filtering rule contains of two parts: a header and a body, where the header contains keys and values from payment request which
trigger the rule once all the key/value pairs match the ones from the payment request.

For example:

.. code-block:: none

    "header" : {
        "mid": "some_merchant_id",
        "currency": "USD"
     },
    "body": {
        "amount": {
            "value":[1000, 10000]
        }
    }

     //The code above indicates that every time we have payment
     //with mid and currency set to "some_merchant_id" and "USD" accordingly
     //the following rule body will be applied:
     //check if amount parameter value of payment request is between 1 and 100 USD

Default payment parameters are (could be modified in definitions section of FelxyGuard admin console):

**data** - additional data that could be sent in "extra_return_param" field on public API

**amount** - tx amount in cents (100 cents = 1 USD)

**gateway_amount** - amount in cents accepted by the acquirer (usually converted from tx amount, 100 cents = 1 USD)

**userid** - lead_id field from Payments object (table)

**email** - payer's email provided on the payment form or via Public API

**tid** - payment unique token assigned by the system

**acq_id** - type of gateway which has been used to facilitate this payment

**status** - payment status (Pending, Approved, Declined)

**ip** - referral IP address

**currency** - currency code (USD, EUR, PLN, CNY, etc)

**gateway_currency** - currency code accepted by the acquirer (USD, EUR, PLN, CNY, etc)

**card** - PAN token attribute of Payment object (table)

**bin** - BIN number  attribute of Payment object (Bank identification number, first 6 digits of PAN)

**order** - an order number assigned by a merchant

**type** - Payment type (PayIn, Payout)

**product** - product description assigned by a merchant

**company_id** - merchant company name

**mcc** - merchant category code, assigned to a merchant account by the settings services

Aggregating parameter values
----------------------------

To implement filtering by a parameter aggregated value (periodic-wise) we have to define which parameters
should be aggregated along with its dependencies from the other parameters

*Example: we need to filter payments according to the accumulated 7 days turnover from a single card*

To do so we need to add definition to FlexyCard and instruct it to start accumulating "amount" parameter values
from a unique "card" parameter value and drop this value every 7 days for each card parameter value.

Also we want to do so for each unique mid, acq_id and currency parameters,
in this case definition must be as following:

.. code-block:: none

    [
        {
            //defining a new parameter to perform aggregation, "mid" wil be the first unique parameter
            "param": {
                "name": "mid",
                //defining next unique nested parameter "acq_id"
                "param": {
                    "name": "acq_id",
                    //another nested unique parameter "currency"
                    "param": {
                        "name" : "currency",
                        //defining card unique nested param
                        "param": {
                            "name": "card",
                            //aggregating amount and setting drop value period to 7 days
                            "param": {
                                "name": amount,
                                "aggr": {
                                    "type": "sum",
                                    "duration": [7]
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }

                }
            }
        }
    ]

The following definitions for aggregates are already predefined in the system and could be changed on
FlexyGaurd admin console:

"mid>acq_id>email>count 1, 7, 30 days" - counts payment within mid, acq_id and single email
"mid>ip>count 1, 7, 30 days" - counts payment from a single ip address within unique mid parameter

etc

'Full list of definitions could be checked on FlexyGuard admin console Definitions>Aggr section from the left menu,
please note that definition are rarely to be modified only in the case of changing the rule
(adding new param to the payment entity) schema or aggregation logic'

FlexyGuard admin console (WEB UI)
---------------------------------

1. Adding a new rule

To add a new rule please navigate to Add Rule page bu clicking FlexyGuard log at the upper left corner

.. image:: img/flexyguard_addrule.PNG

FlexyGuard keywords (count, not_in, not_in_country, not_in_ip_country, value)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**count** - sets a range in which param presence in the payment request count must be checked
  
.. image:: img/flexyguard_count.png

*sets the range for payment count withing one card parameter within 1 and 7 days*

**not_in/in** - checks that parameter value is not in or in the list

.. image:: img/flexyguard_not_in.png

*sets a list of card parameter and checks if card value not in the list*

**not_in_country** - checks if specific parameter value not in the country list associated with this parameter

**in_country** - checks if specific parameter value is in the country list associated with this parameter

.. image:: img/flexyguard_not_in_country.png

*checks if bin parameter value is not in the list*

**value** - checks if parameter value is withing the range

.. image:: img/flexyguard_value.png


Uploading the lists for IP countries and BIN countries parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. image:: img/flexyguard_lists.PNG

To update the parameter (bin, ip) country lists please navigate to the page above

**Uploaded files should be a formatted CSV with headers at the first row**

BIN countries file format example:

    .. code-block:: none

        bin;ps;bank_name;type;sub_type;country;ccode_short;ccode_iso;code;www
        021502;PRIVATE LABEL;;DEBIT;;UNITED STATES;US;USA;840;;

IP address country file example:

    .. code-block:: none

        IP1;IP2;IP1_int;IP2_int;code_short;code_iso;code_number;country_name
        1.0.0.0;1.0.0.255;16777216;16777471;AU;AUS;036;AUSTRALIA


Searching/Modifying the rules
-----------------------------

To search the rule please enter any text on the Search text box

.. image:: img/flexyguard_search.PNG

To modify the rule just follow the link under rule hash value


Rule naming and hashing
-----------------------

When you save a rule the system automatically creates a hash value and descriptor based on header parameters


.. image:: img/flexyguard_hash.png

Please add comment which will be added to the search index along with hash and descriptor,
please mind that proper naming in the comment field will help to easily navigate the rule lists in the future,
for example

*Bank Of China*

*Bank Of China: High risk*

*Bank Of China: High risk: China Airlines*

The first rule has only acq_id parameter at the header and defines the global rule for this bank_name
The second one is for high risk merchant categories, like mcc parameter and acq_id posted on the header
The last one for a specific merchant and has acq_id, mcc, mid parameters in the header


'The headers are unique within the systems, you can't create two rules with the same header value'
