Adjusting commission 
--------------------

You can adjust commission schedule for any payment type using flexy-commission service.

This service works using flexy-guard rule filtering engine where instead of setting up the rules, you post commissions using
the following JSON format:

.. code-block:: none

        {
            "header": {
                "type": "PayinRequest"
            },
            "body": {
                "self": {
                    "rate": "0.5",
                    "fee": "1"
                },
                "provider": {
                    "rate": "0.4",
                    "fee": "0.3"
                }
            }
        }

Where header section identifies payment request params to fetch commission schedule for and body contains of "self" (commission charged by the system) and "provider" (commission charged by payment provider) sections
These sections contain commission schedule defined by the following keywords:

**rate** - rate is % based commission fee (like: 0.5%, 0.6%)

**fee** - stand fee is fixed price commission fee (like: 0.1 USD, 0.4 USD)

Please note that no currency or percentage symbol should be posted along with a float number

To perform initial service setup please follow the steps:

1. Post definition section (defines payment parameters to fetch commission sch. for)
